Problem #3: (a) Given a sorted array of N distinct integers that has been rotated an unknown number of times. Implement (in Java) an efficient algorithm that finds an element in the array. (b) What is the running time complexity of your algorithm? Note: You may assume that the array was originally sorted in increasing order. Example: Input: find 5 in array (15 16 19 20 25 1 3 4 5 7 10 14) Output: 8 (the index of 5 in the array)
